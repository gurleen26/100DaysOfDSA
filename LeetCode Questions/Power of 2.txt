CONCEPT: 
		1) If n is a power of two, the binary representation of n will contain exactly one 1 bit. For example:

		1 = 0001 (binary for 2020)
		2 = 0010 (binary for 2121)
		4 = 0100 (binary for 2222)
		8 = 1000 (binary for 2323)

	        2) The trick is that for any number n that is a power of two: 𝑛&(𝑛−1)=0n&(n−1)=0
	      This works because subtracting 1 from n flips all the bits after the rightmost 1 bit, so the bitwise AND of n and n-1 will result in 0 only when n has exactly one 1 bit.

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        // A number is a power of two if it is greater than 0 and has only one bit set
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
};
