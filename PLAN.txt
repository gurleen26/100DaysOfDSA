Day 36–38: DP INTERMEDIATE

LCS

LIS

0/1 knapsack
Solve each with tabulation + memoization

Day 39–40: Contest-style Problems

Just practice full problems:

Prefix + map

Graph + BFS

Binary search + greedy

⭐ DAILY ROUTINE (Very Simple)
⏱️ 1 hour — Learn one concept

Use:

YouTube (Kunal Kushwaha, Code Library, Take U Forward)

⏱️ 1 hour — Solve 4–5 problems

Start from easy → medium.

⏱️ 10 minutes — Revision

Re-solve one old problem WITHOUT looking at notes.

⭐ How you will improve logic

Understand the pattern, not the question
Example → Split Array Largest Sum = “Binary Search on Answer + Greedy check”

Stop watching full solutions
Only watch 20–30 sec hint → try → if stuck → then see.

Dry run on paper
You already saw how my drawings helped you in partition problems.

Ask why? for every step
ex: “Why am I checking sum <= mid?”

Solve variations
Every question belongs to 1 pattern.
Solve 3–4 from the same pattern.

⭐ Gurleen, this plan will work for you

Because:

You ask good questions

Your basics are fine

You understand fast when explained

You only need structure + consistency
